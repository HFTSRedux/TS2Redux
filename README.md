# Introduction
### What Is TS2 Redux?
**TS2 Redux** is a fan-made project which aims to fix and enhance the port of **TimeSplitters 2** (TS2) contained in the 2016 game **Homefront: The Revolution** as a hidden away as an unlockable easter-egg. This port of TS2 is rendered natively on PC and console in full HD (to 4K), with widescreen and mouse/keyboard/gamepad support. It also uses high-quality assets and audio.

This project installs into Homefront's game folder and unlocks all of TS2 permanently, fixes several game-breaking bugs, adds quality-of-life enhancements, and extra content.

### Where Did This Come From?
Normally, the Homefront TS2 port is limited to just 2 playable story missions: *Siberia* and *Chicago*. Players would need to play through Homefront's campaign for several hours until they reached a TS2-themed arcade cabinet in the game where, when interacted with, would cause TS2 to take over their screen until they exited and resumed playing Homefront's campaign.

The developers who worked on Homefront bundled TS2 into the base game as an easter-egg, but even though players could only access Siberia and Chicago, the entirety of the game was still present [in Homefront's game files](https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/62f9va/could_the_timesplitters_2_demo_in_homefront_tr_be/), including all of TS2's campaign, arcade, and challenge levels. They did it this way because it would have been more work to create a unique version of TS2 just for Homefront as opposed to including the entire game and simply altering the main menu to hide parts that they wanted to block. The port was originally intended to be a standalone remaster, with work beginning as far back as 2008, but at the time Homefront was released in 2016, the TS2 port was unfinished with several game-breaking bugs. The developers included [special cheat codes](UnlockCodes.md) that could be entered in by the player that unlocks the rest of the game, including its various bugs. In 2021, the codes were finally [revealed on Twitter](https://twitter.com/SpencerTheDean/status/1380066334063484935), which lead to the formation of a team of TimeSplitters fans to start working on creating this project.

*For more information on the history and evolution of this project or the TS2 port, see the [Backstory](Backstory.md) page.*

These mod packs can be installed during setup and are permanently enabled until either the corresponding .dll file for that mod is removed (or renamed) from the \Bin64\TS2Redux folder OR by running the installer again and removing the mods you no longer want.

### TimeSplitters 2 Remix Mod

> featuring the same premises as the GameCube version. These changes
> also carry over to its Arcade Mode, where additional content like the
> Mox Weapon and Silenced Lugers are available! Although it lacks the
> custom textures of the original, the remastered Remix Mod makes up for
> it with new features.
> 
> All Story levels have altered music options! New character
> replacements make up some of the enemies you'll encounter, like riot

### Haunted Edition Mod
From [TimeSplitters 2: Haunted Edition - moddb.com](https://www.moddb.com/mods/timesplitters-2-haunted-edition)

# Installing and Uninstalling

### How To Install
To install, follow these steps:

 1. Download the latest version of TS2 Redux from the project's GitHub page: https://github.com/HFTSRedux/TS2Redux/releases
 2. Double-click on the application you just downloaded and follow the on-screen instructions.
![TS2 Redux Installer screenshot](Images/screenshot-installer.png?raw=true)

That's it! After using the installer, the mod will be active the next time you start the game.

### Display Settings
TS2 will inherit Homefront's display settings automatically. If you need to change your resolution or related settings, launch Homefront and change settings from there. You can also change some settings by editing your game.cfg file, located at `%UserProfile%\Saved Games\homefront2\game.cfg` (paste this into the address bar of a Windows File Explorer window).

### Optional: Custom TS2 Launcher
![TimeSplitters 2 custom launcher](Images/ts2-launcher.png?raw=true "TimeSplitters 2 custom launcher")

Want to have a fancy TS2 launcher that skips Homefront's menu and boots right into TS2? The installer (included with this mod) has an option that creates a TS2-themed copy of your Homefront game executable. Just make sure the "Create TS2 Launcher" option is checked during the install process (enabled by default).

### Optional: Reduce Homefront's Size
The installer has an option that removes as much of Homefront's game files as possible, leaving just enough for TS2 to work. This reduces the game's size from 46GB to 2.5GB. Homefront's main menu will still work, which is useful for changing video settings, but you won't be able to play any missions/levels in Homefront.

Once the process is done, all of the non-TimeSplitters files will be moved into a folder called "ripped" located in Homefront's game folder. The installer will also optionally delete this folder for you at the end of the setup process.

### Uninstalling TS2 Redux
To uninstall this mod, simply run the uninstaller application from your start menu. All files added during the initial install process will then be deleted from your PC. If you can't find the uninstaller, you should see it listed in as a program in Windows' add/remove programs list. The uninstaller is also located in your Homefront game folder under Bin64/TS2Redux/Setup.

If you want to disable mods that you previously installed, such as the Remix or Haunted Edition mods, simply open a file explorer and navigate to your Homefront game folder and open the Bin64/TS2Redux folder. There you will see several .DLL files, which correspond to different features that were installed as part of this project. Rename the .DLL file(s) you wish to disable so that it does NOT end in ".DLL" (rename it to ".dll.bak", for example), and that mod file/.dll will not be loaded the next time you run the game.

If something goes wrong and you want to start completely over, you can use Steam's "[Verify integrity](https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/0C48-FCBD-DA71-93EB)" feature to re-download Homefront and restore it back to its original state.

# To-Do / Known-Bugs
There are several features that are either not present in TS2 Redux or are still being worked on.

 - Multiplayer / networking support. LAN and online multiplayer is not currently available. This is a very complex feature to add and our team is still working on this.
	 - Are you a networking guru? Join our team! Message any member of the Redux-Tech group in the TimeSplitters Online Discord server: [https://discord.gg/fBnFZBYht5](https://discord.gg/fBnFZBYht5 "https://discord.gg/fBnFZBYht5").
 - Restore the rain-on-camera effect (when you look up to the sky on a level with rain and water droplets appear on camera).
 - Lighting glitches, such as light from gunfire lighting up walls far from the player. Also present when characters are on fire.
 - Crash on character select screen
	 - When picking your character, if you wait too long or browse through too many characters, the game will crash. We're close to fixing this one, but it's a complex problem that will take time.
 - Mouse sensitivity is messed up (for some users)
	 - If your mouse sensitivity feels like it's broken, open your game.cfg file and add this line to the bottom: `cl_sensitivity = 3` (replace the number 3 with your desired sensitivity level with higher numbers being more sensitive). If this setting gets reverted, you can make your game.cfg file read-only using Windows' built-in file permissions features.
 - Game window is cropped / only one-quarter of the screen is visible (for some users)
	 - If you can only see a portion of the game window (with the rest of it being off screen), then you probably have Super Sampling enabled. You can disable it in Homefront's display settings, or you can edit your game.cfg file and fine the line that reads `cl_sensitivity` and set it to `1`. The line should read: `r_supersampling = 1`

# Frequently Asked Questions

 1. **I have a copy of Homefront: The Revolution for Xbox/PlayStation. Can I use this mod?**
	 - No. This mod is for the PC version of Homefront only. It is not possible to add custom files to the console ports of Homefront. Console players can still use the unlock codes to unlock the full game.
 2. **Do I need to buy Homefront even if I'm only interested in playing TS2?**
	 - Yes. The TS2 Redux project only tweaks your existing copy of Homefront. This project does not contain the core game files to play TS2.
 3. **Where can I get a copy of Homefront?**
	 - Directly from [the Steam store](https://store.steampowered.com/app/223100/) OR buy a Steam key from [GamesPlanet.com](https://us.gamesplanet.com/game/homefront-the-revolution-steam-key--2983-1) (usually cheaper)
 4. **Does the Steam version work for this?**
	 - Yes. Even the disc copy of Homefront is basically a Steam-based installer burned to a DVD.
 5. **I'm only interested in playing TS2. Do I need to keep Homefront's game files on my computer?**
	 - No. The port of TS2 within Homefront is not a standalone program, but it is still possible to remove a vast majority of Homefront's files. This reduces the total size of the game from 46GB to 2.5GB. There is an option available during the installation process where you can choose to have the installer remove your Homefront game files. On the installer, make sure the item "Remove Homefront Game Files" is checked on the "Select Component" step during the install process. Once the installation is completely finished, it will ask you if you want to delete these files permanently.
 6. **Do I have to download all of Homefront just to play TS2?**
	 - If you haven't downloaded Homefront yet, you can optionally download just enough of Homefront from Steam required to play TS2. This saves about 40GB of internet bandwidth. We have created a script called "[TS2-Downloader](https://github.com/HFTSRedux/TS2Redux/wiki/TS2-Downloader-Guide)" that uses a third-party tool DepotDownloader to download specific files from Steam that allows you to play TS2 without having to download all of Homefront. This script is in BETA and requires basic knowledge of how to use Windows batch scripts. If you need help, ask us in Discord.
 7. **How do I change my video display settings?**
	 - Use Homefront's settings menus to change video output settings, among other settings (including mouse sensitivity).
 8. **Do I play through TS2 in order to unlock characters and levels like in the console ports?**
	 - No. Everything is unlocked by default. This includes all characters, story missions, arcade levels, challenge modes, cheats, and minigames (playable from the *Temporal Uplink* weapon). We are looking into how to allow people to progress through the game and unlock things like in the regular game, but that's not available just yet.
 9. **I want to help!**
	 - Join us on the TSO Discord server ([click here](https://discord.gg/fBnFZBYht5)) and message a member of the Redux Tech Team to inquire further.
 10. **Is this any different than playing TS2 in an emulator?**
	 - There are a advantages and disadvantages to this port compared to playing TS2 using an emulator in Xemu (Xbox), Dolphin (GameCube), or PCXS2 (PS2). People have created mods for some of the console ports of TS2 that increase texture resolution, inject mouse/keyboard input, among other things. The overall experience of playing TS2 Redux on PC compared to playing in an emulator is very similar, except TS2 Redux (PC) does all this natively. TS2 on PC also includes high-quality audio, the TS1 map *Chemical Plant*, proper widescreen support, and more.
 11. **Does this work with the Steam Deck?**
	 - Yes. Install Homefront: The Revolution to your Steam Deck as usual, along with the TS2 Redux Installer app (download it from Releases on this project's GitHub page). With Homefront and TS2 Redux now installed, right click on Homefront from your Steam library and click Properties, then look at the General settings section. Add the following line of text to the box labeled Launch Options: `WINEDLLOVERRIDES="dinput8=n,b" %command%`. If you have any trouble, message us on Discord for help.
