# Introduction
### What Is TS2 Redux?
**TS2 Redux** is a fan-made project which aims to fix and enhance the port of **TimeSplitters 2** (TS2) contained in the 2016 game **Homefront: The Revolution**, which was hidden away as an unlockable easter-egg.

This port of TS2 is rendered natively on PC/console in full HD, including up to 4K, with native widescreen and mouse/keyboard/gamepad support. It uses high-quality assets and lossless audio for music and sound-effects. This port of TS2 is the only "HD remaster" of TS2 currently in existence.

Normally, the version of TS2 included in Homefront is limited to just 2 playable story missions: Siberia and Chicago. Players would have to play through Homefront's campaign for several hours until they reach an arcade cabinet located in the game. The player walks up to the cabinet and interacts with it, which triggers TS2 to load and take over their screen until they exit and resume playing Homefront's campaign.

This project, **TS2 Redux**, unlocks all of TS2 permanently, fixes several game-breaking bugs, adds quality-of-life enhancements, and adds extra content.

It's worth noting that this PC port of TS2 was not finished by the original developers, so there are a few rough edges that we're still working on smoothing out (see the *To-Do / Known-Bugs* section below).

*For more information on the history and evolution of this TimeSplitters port, see the Backstory section below.*

# Installing and Uninstalling

### How To Install
To install, follow these steps:

 1. Download the latest version of TS2 Redux from the project's GitHub page: https://github.com/HFTSRedux/TS2Redux/releases
 2. Extract the ZIP file you just downloaded. Extract it to any folder on your PC.
 3. Double-click the batch file named "TS2_Redux-Installer.bat" and follow the on-screen instructions.

That's it! After using the installer, the mod will be loaded the next time you start the game.

### Optional: Custom TS2 Launcher
![TimeSpliiters 2 themed exe](https://i.imgur.com/4oyG4Qu.png)
Want to have a fancy TS2 launcher that skips Homefront's menu and boots right into TS2? The installer script (included with this mod) has an option that creates a TS2-themed copy of your Homefront game executable.

### Optional: Reduce Homefront's Size

The installer script (included with this mod) has an option that removes as much of Homefront's game files as possible, leaving just enough for TS2 to work. This reduces the game's size from 46GB to 2.5GB. Homefront's main menu will still work, which is useful for changing video settings, but you won't be able to play any missions/levels in Homefront.

Once the process is done, all of the non-TimeSplitters files will be moved into a folder called "ripped" located in Homefront's game folder. Once you test to make sure your game runs and works, you can delete this "ripped" folder.

### Removing TS2 Redux
To remove this mod, do the following:

 1. Open a file explorer window and browse to your Homefront game folder.
 2. Delete these files and folders:
	 - Bin64/dinput8.dll
	 - Bin64/TS2Redux/*
	 - Bin64/TimeSplitters2.exe
	 - gamehf2/ts2_redux.pak
	 - gamehf2/ts2_neotokyo_fix.pak

If something goes wrong and you want to start completely over, you can use Steam's "[Verify integrity](https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/0C48-FCBD-DA71-93EB)" feature to re-download Homefront and restore it back to its original state.


# To-Do / Known-Bugs
There are several features that are either not present in TS2 Redux or are still being worked on.

 - Multiplayer / networking support. LAN and online multiplayer is not currently available. This is a very complex feature to add and our team is still working on this.
	 - Are you a networking guru? Join our team! Message any member of the Redux-Tech group in the TimeSplitters Online Discord server: [https://discord.gg/fBnFZBYht5](https://discord.gg/fBnFZBYht5 "https://discord.gg/fBnFZBYht5").
 - Restore the rain-on-camera effect (when you look up to the sky on a level with rain and water droplets appear on camera).
 - Lighting glitches, such as light from gunfire lighting up walls far from the player. Also present when characters are on fire.
 - Crash on character select screen
	 - When picking your character, if you wait too long or browse through too many characters, the game will crash. We're close to fixing this one, but it's a complex problem that will take time.

# Frequently Asked Questions

 1. **I have a copy of Homefront: The Revolution for Xbox/PlayStation. Can I use this mod?**
	 - No. This mod is for the PC version of Homefront only. It is not possible to add custom files to the console ports of Homefront. Console players can still use the unlock codes to unlock the full game.
 2. **Do I need to buy Homefront even if I'm only interested in playing TS2?**
	 - Yes. The TS2 Redux project only tweaks your existing copy of Homefront. This project does not contain the core game files to play TS2.
 3. **Where can I get a copy of Homefront?**
	 - Directly from [the Steam store](https://store.steampowered.com/app/223100/) OR buy a Steam key from [GamesPlanet.com](https://us.gamesplanet.com/game/homefront-the-revolution-steam-key--2983-1) (usually cheaper)
 4. **Does the Steam version work for this?**
	 - Yes.
 5. **I'm only interested in playing TS2. Do I need to keep Homefront's game files on my computer?**
	 - Yes and no. The port of TS2 within Homefront is not a standalone program. It's embedded inside of the Homefront game executable. In order to run TS2, Homefront must be able to run. You can, however, delete most of Homefront's game files reducing the total size of the game from ~46GB down to just ~2.5GB. Use the installer batch script (included with this project) to perform this step.
 6. **How do I change my video display settings?**
	 - Use Homefront's settings menus to change video output settings, among other settings (including mouse sensitivity).
 7. **Do I play through TS2 in order to unlock characters and levels like in the console ports?**
	 - No. Everything is unlocked by default. This includes all characters, story missions, arcade levels, challenge modes, cheats, and minigames (playable from the *Temporal Uplink* weapon).
 8. **I want to help!**
	 - Join us on the TSO Discord server ([click here](https://discord.gg/fBnFZBYht5)) and message a member of the Redux Tech Team to inquire further.
 9. **Is this any different than playing TS2 in an emulator?**
	 - There are a advantages and disadvantages to this port compared to playing TS2 using an emulator in Xemu (Xbox), Dolphin (GameCube), or PCXS2 (PS2). People have created mods for some of the console ports of TS2 that increase texture resolution, inject mouse/keyboard input, among other things. The overall experience of playing TS2 Redux on PC compared to playing in an emulator is very similar, except TS2 Redux (PC) does all this natively. TS2 on PC also includes high-quality audio, the TS1 map *Chemical Plant*, proper widescreen support, and more.

# Backstory
### Origins

The TS2 port found in Homefront was originally destined to be its own game as part of a project to port the game to PC, with work beginning as far back as 2008. The development studio behind TimeSplitters, Free Radical, was focused on other games at the time, including [Haze](https://www.ign.com/games/haze) and [Star Wars Battlefront III](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars:_Battlefront#Star_Wars:_Battlefront_III). Free Radical shut down in late 2008 and was bought by Crytek to become Crytek UK. In 2014, Crytek UK shut down and the the game they were working on at the time, Homefront: The Revolution, was transferred to a new development company, Dambuster Studios, who would continue development of the game.

The entirety of TS2 was included because it was faster to include the whole thing instead of taking the time to create a bespoke version just for this minor easter-egg. So, the menus in TS2 were altered to only show 2 story mode levels and all of the other parts of the menu were hidden or removed. Again, this updated PC port was originally meant to be its own game, but was never finished and was eventually bundled into Homefront, starting as "an office joke".

*"Started as an office joke, like they all do."* - Matt Phillips [via Twitter](https://twitter.com/bigevilboss/status/1378689574759714819)

Supposedly, this port of TS2 has received continued development beyond the half-working version found in Homefront. Dambuster Studio employees are supposedly have a much more polished version of the game (complete with networking support), which may eventually be released as an official remaster.

### The Hunt to Unlock TS2

After Homefront: The Revolution was released in 2016, dataminers discovered that even though only 2 campaign missions in TimeSplitters 2 were playable, [the entirety of TS2's game files were present](https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/62f9va/could_the_timesplitters_2_demo_in_homefront_tr_be/) in Homefront's files. This discovery sparked a multi-year long easter-egg hunt to try to unlock the rest of the game.

[Theories were crafted](https://www.reddit.com/r/oddheader/comments/go8vz0/homefront_the_revolution_undiscovered_easter_egg/) and ideas were tested in-game for countless hours as players tried to crack this elusive easter-egg. Some players experimented in-game while others inspected Homefront's game executable looking for any clues as to how to trigger the full game to become unlocked. There was even an alternate reality game (ARG) conducted by a supposed employee at Dambuster Studios (the studio behind Homefront) which gave players a series of cryptic and obscure clues with the idea that once solved the unlock codes would be revealed.

Unfortunately, this combined effort didn't lead to any significant progress towards unlocking the full game. There were numerous moments of hope along the way, but ultimately the actual unlock codes were never discovered by the small but dedicated community of easter-egg hunters. There was some success in hacking the game's memory to force it load into different story missions beyond Siberia and Chicago, but the vast majority of progress was made only ***after*** the unlock codes were revealed.

### Unlock Codes Revealed
The unlock codes were eventually revealed in April 2021 in a Twitter thread started by the developer who worked on the TS2 port, Matt Philips. Philips revealed that [the entirety of the game was unlockable](https://twitter.com/bigevilboss/status/1378771776595976195) through a series of button presses (with basic multiplayer support too), but he had since lost the unlock codes. A few days later, another Twitter user, Xbox principal software engineer Spencer Perreault, [replied in the thread](https://twitter.com/SpencerTheDean/status/1380066334063484935?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) and shared the game's unlock codes for the first time to the public *(technically the codes were shared a day or two priot to that, but Twitter hid this tweet as spam)*.

This sparked a frenzy of activity as word about the unlock codes spread through the TimeSplitters fanbase. Suddenly, people who had no interest in Homefront were buying copies of this 5-year old [mediocre](https://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/homefront-the-revolution) military shooter just to play an HD remaster of a 2-decade old shooter game from 2002. For the first time in TimeSplitters' history, the game could be played natively on PC in HD with proper mouse/keyboard support.

### The Redux Tech Team Forms
The port of TS2 in Homefront was never actually finished. Since only the first two levels were intended to be playable, many major bugs were left in. Work began by the TS2 modding community to fix these game-breaking bugs so that this unique version of the game could be played properly. A small group joined to form the *Redux Tech Team*, the team behind this project.

This project is called "TS2 Redux" in honor of the internal name given to the PC port of TS2 by the original developers.

# PlayStation & Xbox TS2 Unlock Codes
Consoles players cannot install TS2 Redux to their consoles, but they can still unlock and enjoy TS2 in its entirety by entering in codes using their controller.

### Instructions
1.  Play through Homefront 2 until you reach the Restricted Zone, the final chapter of the storyline. This may take several hours to do.
2.  Locate the arcade cabinet easter egg, walk up to it, and activate it. If you don't know where the arcade cabinet is, watch one of the guides on YouTube to see how to find it. Once you interact with the arcade cabinet for the first time, a new menu option will appear on Homefront 2's main menu under Extras titled "TimeSplitters 2" where you can easily launch TS2 from then on.
3.  Start TimeSplitters 2. The game's title will appear and you will then see the main menu with "Story" and "Quit".
4.  Enter one of the codes below (from the Codes section) while on the main menu.

### Unlock Codes
![TS2 Unlock Codes](https://i.imgur.com/Ua06oHY.png)*Reminder- if you're on PC and using TS2 Redux, you don't need these codes.*

### Tips For Using Unlock Codes

-   You can enter multiple codes in a row (you're not limited to just one at a time).
-   You do not have to enter the codes fast. The game does not seem to have a time limit on how fast codes must be entered.
-   The game does not accept code presses while on the TS2 "Loading" screen. When switching from the main menu to the story mode missions screen, there is a loading screen in between. While this loading screen is present, make sure you don't press any buttons until it's done loading.
-   Switching between different menus does not interrupt a code. The same code can be performed across different menu screens without the code resetting. In other words, you can start entering a code on the TS2 main menu, then go into story mode menu and back and the code will still work. If a code causes you to exit out to the Homefront 2 menu, that is okay. Just go back into TS2 and your code should still be accepted.
