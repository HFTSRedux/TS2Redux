# About
This set of files allows you to use the picture viewer app [XnView](https://www.xnview.com/en/) to filter textures used in TimeSplitters 2 based on areas of the game that those textures appear in. For example, you can quickly browse all of the textures that are unique to the story level *Siberia* for easy browsing and editing.

# How To Install

First, open the XML file provided and ensure that the path to the game folder used is correct. By default, it assumes your game path is:

    D:/Steam/steamapps/common/Homefront_The_Revolution

If your game is installed somewhere else, then you will need to do a search-and-replace to change the path to fit your needs. For example, if your game is installed to your C: drive instead of D:, then replace any instances of `D:\` with `C:\` and save the XML file.

Next, open XnView. On the bottom right, look at the Categories panel. There will be a small button on the far right of that panel with three dots and a separate small button with an arrow. Click this arrow button and a menu should appear. From the menu, click on "Categories Management > Import Categories File".

Find the "*TS2_Categories.txt*" file and select it.

Next, from that same menu, select "File's Categories > Import". Find the "*TS2_Files_List.xml*" file and select it.

# How To Use

Click on "*Categories Filter*" on the far left side of XnView. Under the Categories item you'll see "*TS2*" plus many sub-levels under it. Click on each one to see which textures are associated to that category. Textures that are loaded for specific levels in Arcade and Story are available to filter by.

This is a work-in-progress! There is still much work left to do to organize other textures for easy browsing.
