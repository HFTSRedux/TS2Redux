TS2 WinTileIcons

This mod adds custom set of tile icons for Windows to display in the Start Menu's pins area for TimeSplitters 2: Redux. Normally when you pin a program to Windows 10's start menu, Windows displays a smaller boxed version of the game's icon, which doesn't look very good. This mod changes the icon that appears in your Windows 10 Start Menu so that it appears larger and more eye-pleasing.

If you do not already have a TimeSplitters2.exe located in your Homefront game folder, make one. Open a Windows file Explorer and navigate to your Homefront game folder, which is located inside your Steam folder. Example: "C:\Steam\steamapps\common\Homefront_The_Revolution" (may vary depending on your setup). With your Homefront game folder open, open the Bin64 folder. You should then see Homefront's game EXE, "Homefront2_Release.exe". Make a copy of this EXE and rename it to "TimeSplitters2.exe".

To apply this mod, simply copy the XML file named "TimeSplitters2.VisualElementsManifest.xml" along with the folder named "tileicons" to your Homefront game's folder (example: C:\Steam\steamapps\common\Homefront_The_Revolution\Bin64). Once copied, pin the game's EXE to your Start Menu (right click on the EXE and choose "Pin To Start"). The game should then appear in your Start Menu with a new fancy icon.

If you already have the game pinned to your Start Menu, un-pin the game and re-pin it for changes to take effect.
