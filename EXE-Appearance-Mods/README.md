# Intro
This mod makes your Homefront game executable look like it's a TimeSplitters 2 executable instead. You will be left with an EXE named "TimeSplitters2.exe" with an icon that goes with it. There is also extra icons that appear when you pin the game to your Windows start menu.

This is a purely cosmetic mod and does not change the behavior of the game in any way. To make the EXE launch directly into TS2, use the Straight-To-TS2 mod by Devildwarf.

# How To
To apply this mod, run the batch script located in this folder. It will ask where your Homefront game folder is located on your computer. Copy and paste the path to your game folder into the command prompt window and it will then do the work for you. Once done, you will have a new TimeSplitters 2 themed EXE located next to your existing Homefront EXE.

# Don't Want To Run an EXE?
Some users may feel hesitant to run a Batch script or EXE from the internet they might not trust. If you are one of these people, you can apply the icon manually. Download and use the application "Resource Hacker" (not included) to insert the included icon into your EXE. See Resource Hacker's docs for instructions.

The CodeFusion project file is also available, which lets you download a fresh copy of CodeFusion online and use the provided file, "TS2 CodeFusion.cfp", to patch your EXE.
